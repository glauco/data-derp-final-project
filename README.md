## Barcelona Rent Price Evolution (2005 - 2023)

Since the 1992 Olympic Games, Barcelona has transformed into one of the most visited cities in the world. The event reshaped the city's dynamics, attracting an influx of tourists and immigrants. Alongside this growth the city saw an economic boost, improved infrastructure, and cultural recognition, but it also led to a sharp rise in the cost of living. 

Today, one of the most pressing concerns for residents is the skyrocketing rent prices.
While tourism is often cited as the primary factor driving up rent costs, our analysis aims to explore the correlation between the number of new households and the rise in rental prices. As residents of the city, we are particularly interested in understanding the local dynamics that shape the current rent market.
